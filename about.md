Hello, there!

*Do or do not, there is no try!* My name is [Wagner Hitomi](https://linkedin.com/in/wyhitomi) and I love make things happen! I'm a fighter and an entrepreneur, I love the startups, having worked on several of them, each one in different stages. And I like people even more, although I'm the introvert type, and a *NERD*. At first contact you might think "*sigh... he is an a$@*"... but you also might consider me a funny person - even though you don't undestand a word I'm saying.

You can find me on twitter as [@wyhitomi](https://twitter.com/wyhitomi). DMs are open. Or we can have a coffee :coffee: (or a beer :beers:) anywhere. I anticipaded people's most desired retirement, I'm living on the beach with my loved wife [Renata](https://instagram.com/renatahitomii) and my son [Satoru](https://instagram.com/bloguinhobabyjapa). We sleep and wake up with the sound of the waves.


## What I'm doing

I'm a SRE at [@VoltzMotorsTech](https://twitter.com/VoltzMotorsTech). What this means? I don't have a clue :monocle_face:, but I'll be writing about it for sure! :sunglasses:!

## A Brief Story of Time

### Specialist SRE, ClickBus - June 2020 - December 2021

I joined the former DevOps squad to help evolve ClickBus's Infrastructure. There what I have to do to become a comprehensive and human boss, even though people might misjudge you.
