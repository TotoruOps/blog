:wave:Hello, there!

*Do or do not, there is no try!* My name is [Wagner Hitomi](https://linkedin.com/in/wyhitomi) and I love make things happen! I'm a fighter and an entrepreneur, I love the startups, having worked on several of them, each one in different stages. And I like people even more, although I'm the introvert type, and a *NERD*. At first contact you might think "*sigh... he is an a$@*"... but you also might consider me a funny person - even though you don't understand a word I'm saying.

You can find me on twitter as [@wyhitomi](https://twitter.com/wyhitomi). DMs are open. Or we can have a coffee :coffee: (or a beer :beers:) anywhere. I anticipaded people's most desired retirement, I'm living on the beach:beach_umbrella: with my loved wife [Renata](https://instagram.com/renatahitomii) and my son [Satoru](https://instagram.com/bloguinhobabyjapa). We sleep and wake up with the sound of the waves.


## What I'm doing

I'm a SRE at [@VoltzMotorsTech](https://twitter.com/VoltzMotorsTech). What this means? I don't have a clue :sweat_smile:, but I'll be writing about it for sure! :sunglasses:!

## :peanuts: A Brief Story of Time

### Specialist SRE, ClickBus - June 2020 - December 2021

I joined the former DevOps squad to help evolve ClickBus's Infrastructure. There I learned what I have to do to become a comprehensive and human boss, even though people might misjudge you. One of the most dificult situations for me happened there, and I learned a LOT from it.

### Development Coordinator, Hubchain - August 2018 - May 2020

Same company, new position, first leadership experience! A lot of experience and learnings. As a coordinator I was responsible for granting things were delivered, deal with clients and act as a shield for the engineers. There I`ve improved not just my Product Vision, but also my interview and management skills.

### Blockchain Developer, HubChain - March 2018 - August 2018

New technology! Blockchain had come to change the world with only [two pizzas](https://exame.com/future-of-money/criptoativos/o-que-e-bitcoin-pizza-day-conheca-a-data-comemorada-neste-domingo/). I learned how blockchain and crypto works and helped build not only several blockchain but also applications that connects to the blockchain ecossystem.

### Infrastructure and Cloud Analyst, Geofusion - June 2015 - February 2018

First startup, first cloud operations experience. I learned the importance of working on what matters, automation and configuration management. There I also learned what is DevOps.

### Support Analyst, SQLTech - January 2013 - May 2015

I learned that even big companies have "short" budgets for IT projects. I learned how govern projects works and how they use technology to resolve their problems.
